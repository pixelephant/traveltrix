			<h3>Be far. Feel local.</h3>
			<p>Sightseeing tours may differ from each other completely. There are audio-guided tours, mobile-guided tours, sightseeing buses, travelbooks, simply strolling along the streets and so on. None of these options can provide real personal interaction, that makes your holiday lively and vibrant. Don’t misjudge private guides! They are not equal to all the listed ones above. This is the only option, where continuous interaction is possible, where your tour can be customized perfectly to you with the help of a real insider. Traveltrix’s sightseeing project guarantees live alternative to all others.</p>
			<p>’I am perfectly familiar with all opportunities of sightseeing tours and unfortunately, there are two far ends among all. One, that is boring and represents some kind of competition between guide and tourists, who falls asleep first. And the other, where not the factual information, but learning by fun, legends and personal experiences rules. Traveltrix represents the second one, just as I do. That’s why I dedicated my time and knowledge to this site.’</p>

			<h3>Be far. Feel healthy.</h3>
			<p>All people need to stop sometimes for a while and to recover. Traveltrix’s health&wellness sub-site guides you through this refreshing, no matter, whether it is a spa, a salt-cave or a hiding wellness point on the countryside where to spend a longer period of time. Read the blog-posts or filter among the opportunities and let this site help you find out the way of refilling yourself with energy.</p>
			<p>’Traveltrix. Be far. Feel home? This slogan made me interested a lot, however, firstly I didn’t get the main mission. As I consulted with the Traveltrix Team, I found out, Traveltrix is all about providing filtered highest quality to travelers in several fields. Getting healthier? Stretching out in hot thermal baths? Or expectional dentistry service for reasonable price? Hungary is the place to be, if someone wants to completely recover. Via Traveltrix, I can show you how!’</p>

		<div class="detail" id="for-mission">
			<h3>Mission One</h3>
			<p>Real locals know much more about the resort and they are more authentic, than any marketing-oriented company, however, these local experts are hiding. Traveltrix helps them to show up and to provide a better place to be, where travellers can feel home from the very first moment!</p>	
			<h3>Mission Two</h3>
			<p>We believe in active refreshing and active holiday. The more adventure and more experience you participate in, the more energized you are after returning to home. We want to help change all people’s attitude, who travel abroad to visit a new place, however, they sleep and relax a lot there, instead of being involved and inspired by local secrets and jumping into the local life. We show them, how to do so!</p>
			
			<h3>Mission Three</h3>
			<p>Your holiday, your time, your life! Traveltrix shows the way, how to perfectly customize your own holiday, how to be your own tour-agent, in order to experience as much as you can and only, what, with whom and at what cost you really want. </p>
			<h3>Mission Four</h3>
			<p>We want to create the first touristic social site, where all members are involved and motivated to create a better travelling life!</p>
			
			<p>We fight for these missions everyday. The more help and support we get, the faster we can shake up the  travelling culture. Please, if you want to join and to help the Traveltrix team, <a class="launch" href="#">leave us a message or say hello to us</a>!

			<h3>Be far. Feel Extreme.</h3>
			<p>Gosh! Nothing can be more fulfilling than approaching the beautiful green fields by 200 km/h. Parachuting? Simply flying or steering an airplane? Rafting? Rock-climbing? I want all of them and possibly at the same time. Extreme sports are about to leave your comfort zone. Without leaving that, you have no chance to get to absolutely new discoveries, thoughts, feelings. Be brave and do not hesitate to jump! Noone can guarantee, that it will be the most comfortable experience in your life, but this is not the goal. The point is to find yourself. Give it a try! You’ll learn something new about yourself for sure and 90% is also fun. The last 10% is sweating! That’s a far deal.</p>
			<p>’Traveltrix is a platform, where locals, basically experts of a concrete touristic field, have the perfect chance to show the hidden opportunities of their country. I am a fan of all kind of extreme sports and activities since I was born. That’s my life and I wanna share my experiences with others, too. I know all secret opportunities. Traveltrix provides the online platform. I guess, this is a good combination.’</p>

			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p><strong>Traveltrix. Be far. Feel home!</strong></p>
			<p>Have you ever felt uneasy, bored, unoriented or simply lost somewhere around the World? Or have you ever returned to home after a pretty costly holiday without being fully inspired by local experience, people and with an embarrassing feeling ’Gosh! What on earth did I do over there? I didn’t exploit all the opportunities, I could. However, I spent a lot of money on accommodation and flight.’ That’s a pity!</p> 
			<p>Traveltrix is a solution for all these.</p> 
			<p>We believe in locals, as…</p>
			<ol>
				<li>No one knows resorts, cities and their secret beauties better, than they do.</li>
				<li>Locals love showing travellers the real side of their living place and life, however…</li>
				<li>Real, authentic insiders are hiding and they lack the interface to reach travellers.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We believe in self-organising travelling culture as an alternative of mass-tourism, as…</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Only proactive self-organising travellers have the opportunity to visit the real local secrets, instead visiting only the general, mainstream touristic sights.</li> 
				<li>Self-organising lets you perfectly customize your holiday in order to make it fit to your dreams, your pace, your personality.</li> 
				<li>Active refreshing is far better, than passive one and it may come true only if you do not let the mass-tourists to restrain you, schedule your holiday and make you adapt to them!</li>
				<li>Self-organising is often far cheaper, than hiring a travel agent!</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is no such a suitable interface, where local experts and self-organising travellers can meet each other and match their wishes.</p> 
			<p>Traveltrix is a start-up company, which recently launched after winning the third price in general on a renowned start-up competition and the first place in online and mobile application category Traveltrix helps local experts in tourism to share all the secrets with travellers and it provides an interface for self-organising travellers to be proactive and organise their own holiday according to their real dreams.</p>
			<p>Basically two sorts of touristic companies exist. One, which runs internationally without any local representatives, and the other one, which is purely local. None of them are good enough. Either, they do not care about the real wishes and focus on mass-customization or they have no real effect on customer habits and travelling culture.</p> 
			<p>Traveltrix.org combines both - internationality and locality in order to evangelize the self-organising travelling culture and help locals to meet proactive international travellers from all around the world. That’s, what we believe in and fight for it! Let’s shake up tourism and make it more personal in order to help travellers to be far and feel home, no matter, where they travel to.</p>

			<h2>Ákos Fodor</h2>
			<p>“I will never forget my best pal’s words: ‘Hungary is not sooo bad country’. I understand, but I feel sorry for the depression and the irony, that characterize a few Hungarians. They must be blind for beauty. Budapest and Hungary are simply wonderful. I wake up and go to sleep here everyday, but I never miss a day to see the River Danube, to sit down at its bank to eat a sandwich or to sip a beer. I simply love living here and being a Hungarian.</p>
			<p> I am an economist, but half-time professional tour-guide, too and I was always glad to stroll along the secret beauties with curious travellers. I consider myself a local expert and I know, so many others are hiding all around the World. Where are you? I hope, you’re out there. Traveltrix is a vision of mine. Traveltrix will be an international place for local heroes, ready to provide something extraordinary and for proactive travellers, who cannot be satisfied by mass-customized, general scenes. Traveltrix matches them and helps to be far and feel home!”</p>

			<h2>Sándor R. Kiss</h2>
			<p>“I was already 16 years old, when I got the first chance to leave my home country, Hungary, as a tourist. I organized the whole trip by myself. By the time I’ve realized, that if you are at a completely new place, you never have enough time and you lack the real orientation, how to explore the local secrets, and at the end of the day, you missed and passed a lot of secret highlights and left the visited place without real experiences.</p>
			<p>I believe that Traveltrix spares time for the travellers and provides value-added offers. I dedicate my job to understand people’s needs as tourists, and create them simple, informative, experience-focused solutions, wherever they travel on the Earth.”</p>
